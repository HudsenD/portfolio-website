                    As a driven developer with close to two years immersed in the web3 landscape, I possess a deep
                    passion for blockchain innovations. My technical expertise spans JavaScript/Typescript, Solidity,
                    EVM, Hardhat, EthersJS, NextJS, The Graph, Wagmi, and more. I'm continuously on the lookout for
                    opportunities to broaden my horizons and deepen my understanding in this dynamic field.
